    The SSL socket code provided is using mbedtls, but one could use BearSSL if size is really limited instead.

/** Simple socket code.
    If set to true, this disables the optimized network code from ClassPath and fallback to the minimal subset
    of BSD socket API (typically send / recv / connect / select / close / setsockopt).
    This also limits binary code size but prevent using SSL/TLS (unless you write a wrapper for it).
    This is usually enabled for embedded system with very limited resources.

    Please notice that this also change the meaning of timeout values. If it's not set, then timeouts represent
    the maximum time that a method could spend (including all sub-functions calls). It's deterministic.
    When it's set, then timeouts represent the maximum inactivity time before any method times out. So if you
    have a very slow connection sending 1 byte per the timeout delay, in the former case, it'll timeout after
    the first byte is received, while in the latter case, it might never timeout and take up to
    `timeout * packetLength` time to return.

/** Low latency mode
    If set to 1, this will only wait on the receiving socket in a non blocking fashion.
    You'll use this if you need to do other processing in your main application loop. It reduces latency for your
    other application code at the cost of increased CPU usage since the loop time will decrease from the default
    timeout set to mainly the duration of a system call.

    This allow implies you provide a BSD compatible select function for the socket implementation.
